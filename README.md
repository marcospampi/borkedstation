### BorkedStation PlayStation Emulator
This is an experimental, totally inaccurate, borked, PSX emulator I'm working on my free time as a hobby. 
The main focus of this emulator is to learn how the crap an emulator works and research new stuff. 

#### Remember the bios, lil' fella
Just drop you bios under `user_data`, this thing's being developed using the european one.
